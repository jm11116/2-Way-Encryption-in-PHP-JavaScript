A basic method of two-way encryption, implemented in PHP. It takes a message and obfuscates it by inserting random letters, symbols, and numbers between each character of the message, and decrypts it by scrubbing an input string of those predefined sequences. This method of encryption is of course not secure, as anyone who can indentify the recurring patterns in the encrypted messages resulting from it could easily just remove them, laying the original message bare. But, if you need a quick-and-dirty way to make something unreadable to the casual observer, this method is a fast and efficient way to go.
